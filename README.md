# Bullying Discord Electron

This project is the **JavaFX-based GUI** for **Saferoom**, designed with one mission in mind:  
**Crush Electron. Burn its RAM-hogging legacy to the ground.**

## Why JavaFX?

Because weâ€™re tired of pretending Electron is okay.

- ðŸš€ **Lightweight** â€“ No bloated Chromium engine per app.
- ðŸ§  **Low Memory Usage** â€“ Uses *actual* megabytes, not hundreds of them.
- âš¡ **Blazing Fast** â€“ Launches instantly. No loading spinner, no drama.
- ðŸ”Œ **Native Performance** â€“ Tight integration with the OS. No lag, no bullshit.
- â˜• **Pure Java** â€“ If you're already in the JVM world, this is home.

## Performance Comparison

| Feature               | Electron (e.g., Discord) | JavaFX (This Project)  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| RAM Usage             | 300-600 MB               | 50-100 MB               |
| CPU Load              | Spikes constantly        | Minimal & efficient     |
| Startup Time          | 5-10 seconds             | Under 1 second          |
| Overall UX            | Feels like molasses      | Feels like butter       |

**Electron is a meme. JavaFX is the answer.**
